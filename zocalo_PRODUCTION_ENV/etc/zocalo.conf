#  This file provides configuration information to the Zocalo server

# The admin password is defined in the configuration file.  The default
# value (the word "unsafe") is published on sourceforge!  You must
# change it to a new value to have any security!  Pick something
# people won't guess.  You can remind yourself of what it is whenever
# you need to by looking at this file.
# 
# When someone has authenticated as admin, they can create new markets
# after logging in.  You drop admin authentication by logging in
# without a password.  You authenticate as admin by logging in with
# any name (whether known or not) and the password from the config
# file.

# The password that allows creation of markets.  Change
# it here and restart the server to make the change effective.

admin.password: admin@786

# the network port on which to listen.  If not specified, defaults to
# 80, the standard port for the web.  If there is more than one web
# server running on a machine, they need to use different numbers.

server.port: 30020

#enable the INSECURE RPC server.  Default is false.

#RPC.server.enable: false

# the network port on which the RPC server will listen.  If not

# There's an alternate format for the trading page that allows the trader to specify the 
# total cost limit for a trade rather than the price limit.  The price limit format is the
# default.  set useCostLimit to true to choose the other format.

useCostLimit: true

#  Some groups use the prediction market configuration of Zocalo for
# laboratory experiments.  In those cases, access to trading history
# can be a problem, so you can turn off those links.  When
# suppress.history.links is true, the history link doesn't appear as
# one of the navigation buttons at the top of each web page, and the
# ListMarkets page doesn't list closed markets.  Admin users get
# access to both features regardless of the setting.

suppress.history.links: false

# When the Prediction Markets configuration is used for lab experiments, traders shouldn't 
# be able to look at the trading history.  When this option is set to true, only the Admin 
# user  has access to history.

# How much money should new user accounts be allocated?  The default
# value is $1000.

# In lab experiments it can be useful to provide a simple way for
# users to move to the next open market.  Setting this value to true
# does that.
