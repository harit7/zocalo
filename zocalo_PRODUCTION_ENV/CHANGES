Changes through April, 2011

Bug Fix for the RPC server.  (It's been broken since I converted to Prices and
Quantities)

Changes through February, 2011

Added description of the lending markets to the CONFIGURATION file. 

Changes through January, 2011 (2011.1 Release)

No changes in functionality.  This is purely a bug fix for a bug that
has been observed in both Experiment and Prediction Market
configurations.  The bug can't happen if the code compiles correctly,
so the fix is a no-op to fool the Java runtime in case the code
doesn't run correctly.

Changes through November, 2010  (2010.1 Release)

Experiments using lending can base loan values on historical costs
Config flag allows suppression display of detailed accounting table
When lender can't repay, give a warning before liquidation
Refactor stripchart.js
Improve reporting script
Ensure defaulters continue to collect dividends while liquidation proceeds

  repaired some bugs affecting display in the Experiment configuration

CHANGES THROUGH  December 31   (2009.3 Release)

This release features a complete replacement of all float- and
double-based arithmetic  with BigDecimals.  There are no feature
changes.

Consistently enforce WholeShareTrading flag.

    judges scored from table of values.
    Manipulators get diff btwn actual value and average trading value
    disable (with a timer) judges entering scores
Judge default estimate is 50.
Support Unary trading, including short sales and reserves.
Provide many more configurable labels used in reporting scores.
Enable limited Judges' choices using sliders or pull-downs

Track time of last trade so we don't have to regenerate charts on every request.
Closed markets remember and display their outcomes. 
Stable sort order for positions in graphs.

    FIXED BUGS

Quantity limit wasn't being enforced.
SourceForge: (#1987559).  Book orders could trade more shares than requested
Some transactions were interleaved.  Added a synchronize block at the top level.
Shue (sourceforge) showed how to repair bug requiring double ant build

CHANGES THROUGH MAY 2008 (2008.3 Release)

The change to the database format for MarketMakers is not backwards compatible.  If you have a database with multi-outcome markets that are worth saving (considering that the MarketMaker code was broken), you should run the migrate2008-3.py script.

Synchronize access to server to prevent race conditions in trading.
Update svn version file when building a tar or zip file
Extract session state to simplify development of new experiment protocols

      EXPERIMENTS

Provide access to processed logfiles from Exerimenter's page.
Update logToColumns
Identify logged events so asynchrony in log4j won't produce anachronistic log files
Ensure session config info is logged.

      PREDICTION MARKETS

 Make redemptions work for multi-markets.
 Subsidy/Beta wasn't stored in database, severely breaking MarketMakers
 rewrote MarketMaker algorithm to trade coupons when available
 clean up account creation and registration
 report costs of purchasing from MM (rather than mean of high and low)
 Tell user how much holdings cost to purchase

            UI CHANGES
  stable sort order for positions in input forms.
  allow question marks in claim descriptions.
  Show graph of two position multi-outcome market as one line.
  Show market maker price
  ensure price chart runs zero-100
  Display prices as cents rather than dollars
  display book orders when there's no marketMaker
  add refresh button (in cost limit)
  remember input details for selected row.
  Trade history sorts most recent first.


CHANGES THROUGH April 2008 (2008.2 Release)

      PREDICTION MARKETS

Added ability to configure so traders specify a cost limit on
multi-outcome markets rather than a quantity limit.  When doing so,
the UI for order entry changes.

Fixed some reported problems concerning creation of new accounts.

      EXPERIMENTS

Support private dividends so each trader can be given distinct incentives.

CHANGES THROUGH March 2008 (2008.1 Release)

include log4j.properties files in both distributions to suppress extraneous  warnings
drop .../webpages/ from urls

      PREDICTION MARKETS

Support for xml-rpc for MIT-CCI automated agents (triggered by RPC.server.enable flag)
UI Changes suggested by MIT-CCI group (rev 505, 502)
Improve email confirmation instructions
Some automatic schema migration support

      EXPERIMENTS

Add flag to enable suppression of display of Carry Forward scores
updates to logToColumns to report more details (for GMU experiments)
fix average price computation

       DEVEL ENVIRONMENT

Rearranged top-level devel directories to not use svn:externals
Moved webpages into parallel hierarchy like etc and bin.

CHANGES THROUGH September 2007 (2007.4 release)

Updated Prediction Market INSTALL documentation to better describe
admin powers.


CHANGES THROUGH July, 2007 (2007.2 release)

    PREDICTION MARKETS
  
New users can create an account; confirmation (via mail) is
required.  Admin can no longer create accounts unilaterally.
The confirmation mail message text is locally configurable.
root.password has been renamed to admin.password (and "root"
has been replaced with "admin" in all user-visible places.)

    EXPERIMENTS

Fixed a session-interaction bug that could cause sessions to
end early.  allow times to be specified in minutes and
seconds.  When displayAverages is specified in config file,
compute and display the average trade price as part of the
score table.

Allow experimenters to control what logo is shown in
experiments.

Made labels displayed to subjects in experiments more
customizable.  Allow experimenters to highlight messages.
(allow use of html) Don't allow html characters in market
names and descripitons.

CHANGES THROUGH April 16, 2007 (2007.1 release)

   PREDICTION MARKETS

The software now requires use of Java 1.5.
 
multi-outcome markets are supported using a market maker.  

Add more chart types: show best price frontier for book
orders; display market-maker markets with a continuous price
line; Display multiple prices for multi-outcome markets.
MarketMakers don't transact at a single price, so the charts
should show how the prices move.

Claim creation has a separate page, and is easier to find.

   EXPERIMENTS

Support experiments without manipulators or judges.  Allow
configuration of multiple kinds of traders with different
initial assets and cash.

Allow the maximum price to be changed for an experiment.
