This software is based on the Zocalo Prediction Market, created by Chris Hibbert, of the Massachussetts Institute of Technology.
<br>
We hope you had a enjoyable interaction with our software. We are students, however, and we must have made a bunch of mistakes- and there certainly is an enormous room for improvement. We would love to have your feedback!
