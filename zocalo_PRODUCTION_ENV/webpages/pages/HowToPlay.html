1. Create an account and login to the system.</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   On creation of account you will get INR 1000 (Virtual :P) in your account.</br> 
2. After logging into the system you will see your home page where you can see the following</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   a) Currently Open Markets</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   b) Your balance</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   c) Shares you are holding</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   d) Your purchase history</br>
3. Now to buy or sell shares click on any of the open markets link and it will take you to a console where you can buy or sell the shares of the team you want.</br>
</br>
Following set of FAQ will guide you through the further process:</br>

<font color=black size= 4> <b>1. What is this game all about?</b></font></br> 
	This game is very much similar to stock market. Here you will be buying the shares of the team 
        that you feel has more chances of winning. For each match there is a "Market", that you can see
	in your home page.To predict the outcome of match you have to go to the "Market" corresponding to that match.
	
        You are given 1000 Rupees at the creation of account. You will use this money to buy
        the shares of any team.   
</br>
<br>
<font color=black size= 4> <b>2. What is the current rate of shares and where do I find it?</b></font></br> 
      In the console you see a list of teams and corresponding current rate of shares.
      The "Current Share Price" indicates the probability of that team winning the game.	
      i.e. if there are two teams India, Pakistan and 70,30 are the current price of shares of them respectively.
      Then it means that Chances of India winning the game are 70/100 and that of Pakistan are 30/100.
</br>
<br>
<font color=black size =4><b>3. How do I buy shares of a team?</b></font></br>
	To buy the shares of any team you have to increase the rate of shares of that team.
	</br>
	Let's say the current rate of India's shares is 60 and you want to buy the shares of India. 
        This means you feel probability of India winning the game is greater than 60%.
        Or in other way If you are buying the sharess of India that means chances of India winning 
        the game are more since someone in the market is putting his money on it.
	</br>

         Go to the "My Bid" cell corresponding to the team whose shares you want to buy. 
         In this cell enter the rate/probability that you feel is appropriate and click on the "Trade" button or Hit enter.<br> </br>
	 If the rate of shares at the time of buying was R and you get X shares as a result of trade 
         then R*X amount will be deducted from your account.
	</br>
	 Note: You should have sufficient balance to do the trade, otherwise no shares will be given to you.
	
  </br></br>
<font color=black size =4><b>4. How many shares will I get?</b></font></br>
 
	When you bid your price for a team.The number of shares(let's say S) that you get 
	depends on your current balance, current rate of shares and your bid.</br>

	In plain english:</br>
	If the current rate is low ==> you will get more shares. (S will be high)</br>
	current rate is high ==>  you will get less shares. (S will be low)</br>

	Here we will not go into the math of how S is computed, If you are interested in it feel free to contact us.
<br></br>
<font color=black size =4><b>5.How do I sell shares of a team?</b></font></br>
	In the console you see a list of shares you are holding. 
        To sell any particular holding click on the "sell holding" button corresponding to it. 
        If the current rate of the shares you are holding is too low i.e. 0.01 paise then your shares remain unsold.
        so you have to wait for the price of shares to increase. Also if the rate of shares goes above 
        the rate at which you bought then selling them at that time would be profitable to you.
<br></br>
<font color=black size =4><b>6. How do I maximize my profit?</b></font></br>
	Let's start Backwards, :)<br>
	At the end of the game if you have S shares of some team let's say India, <br>
	There are two cases:<br>
	1. India wins : money you get = S* 1 Rupee = S <br>
	2. India loses: money you get = S* 0 Rupee = 0 <br>

        So strategy for you would be to hold the shares of the team which you feel is going to win.<br>

	You can earn profit even before the match has ended. let's say you bought the shares of India when the its rate was 10 paise and the 	current rate is 80 paise then selling at this point of time will result in net profit.<br>
	However If you can wait till the end of the match and India wins then you will earn even more profit. 
        So it might be a good Idea to hold on the shares till the endd. 
        But in case you feel India is going to loose so it might be a good idea for you to sell when the rate is 80.<br>
       (Something is better then nothing :D)<br>
</br></br>

<font color=black size =4><b>7. What is 1 paisa?</b></font></br>

	1 Rupee = 100 paisa (Similar to $1 = 100 cents).
</br>
<br>
<font color=black size =4><b>Examples:</b></font></br>

<font color=black size =3><i>Case 1:</i></font></br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; Suppose Current Share Prices are:</br>

   &nbsp; &nbsp; India &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;     50</br>
   &nbsp; &nbsp; Zimbabwe  &nbsp; 50</br>
   
&nbsp; &nbsp; You feel that chances of India winning the game are 80% so you increase the current shares price of India to 80. i.e. your bid is 80.
</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; That means you have bought S no. of shares of India at the current price i.e. 50. </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Now suppose if at the end of the game India wins then </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amount you get = S*1 Rupee = S*100 ==> profit = S*100 - S*50 </br>

<font color=black size =3><i>Case 2:</i></font></br>
 &nbsp; &nbsp;  Suppose Current Share Prices are:</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   India &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  97   </br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;   Zimbabwe  &nbsp;                    3   </br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; At this point of time shares of Zimbabwe are very cheap, 
              so you can buy lots of them by paying a very small amount and in case 
              it wins you will have huge profit i.e 97 paise per share.</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Let's say you feel the probability of Zimbabwe winning the game is 80/100 then you will bid 80 for Zimbabwe and get S shares.</br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amount charged 	=	S*3 paise.<br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i> Zimbabwe wins then</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp; Amount you get 	=	S*100 paise   =>  profit = S*100 - S*3 paise.</br> 
&nbsp; &nbsp; <i>If Zimbabwe loses then</i><br>
&nbsp; &nbsp;  amount you get = 0. => profit = 0 - S*3 paise.
