Prediction Market Notification
Hi $user,

This is  test Email
You feel that chances of India winning the game are 80% so you increase the current shares price to 80. i.e. your bid is 80.
That means you have bought S no. of shares of India at the current price i.e. 50. 
now suppose if at the end of the game India wins then you will get S*1 Rupee = S*100 paise Rupee in you account.

Cheers,
IWP Team
