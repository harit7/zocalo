the frontpage should show some activity, even when not logged in, so visitors can see things happening: most active, recent, expiring soon or completed markets. Also, the layout should be flexible, e.g. using cascading style sheets, so we can make changes to the look and feel easily. Registered users should at least be able to change their screen name, password and email, and preferably add an image or links.  Users should be able to configure their choice of trading style (price limit vs. value limit.)  A language file or other means for translation would be nice to for use in non native english speaking countries.

When re-writing experiments, scoring should be done by a strategy object that asks session for dividends, etc, asks trader for cash and coupons, and can render html, log, etc.

MarketMaker.buyWithPriceLimit() took PRICE as an INT, but it's now DOUBLE. See if it needs to be scaled or something.

Quadratic Rule (or something for date-range claims)

Some (quarterly?) Markets: non-farm payroll, unemployment, cpi,
business confidence, occupancy rates (local?)
  Use gov't numbers so no IP problems.  Cut off trading day before.

Replace opposite() in Claim with complementaryPositions.  BinaryClaim

return a collection.

Re-check logToColumns.pl.  (set up a regression test?)

Unify stripchart/Action descendents with history/*Records
- make Actions use SecureUser rather than user.name()
x was TradeRec.addTo() only for testing?  How will *Records be resurrected from DB?
         It was.  We already retrieve Actions using queries.  Good Enough.
           Let's continue to convert the data a la AllMarkets.getHistoricalPrices() for now.
   Transaction date is date of every sub-Action
   Remove PriceHistoryRecord when everything is converted to Actions

x BookTradeRec ==> BookTrade
      Should BookTrade point to the Order [Not for initial Impl: MultiMarkets]
x MarketTradeRec==> MakerTrade   (average price, trader)
       When you retrieve from MakerTrade in the DB, you'll get all the info
x PriceChangeRec ==> add to stripchart/
(later) TransactionRec ==> add to stripchart/
   Market, MarketMaker, Book have to pass around transaction records

   PriceHistoryRec is root TradeRec(BookTRec&MarketTRec), PriceChangeRec,TransactionRec
   TradeHistory  is the ReloadablePage that currently displays transactions in a table
   PriceHistory is used by HistoryTest to create TimePeriodValuesCollections as an example

Multi-Markets currently have marketmaker, but no book markets.  With a market maker, you want
to display trades as moving a price from open to close.  With BookMarkets, trades happen at
particular prices, and prices can move before, after, or between trades.  
x       BookMarkets want to show newBest(Bid/Ask)
x       AMMs want to show open/close.
x        Trade/Maker already shows open/close
       TransactionRec is used to combine multiple BookTrades (and MarketTrades)
	      it's unnecessary when you only have AMM.
         Should I build TransactionRecs for Binary markets?  That would allow history to show
		 bestOffers as well as multiple transactions as ranges rather than average price.

Make the simple binary market show volume in its plot using a
CombinedDomainXYPlot.  Adjust the sizes of the plot using weights in 
the call plot.add(subplot, weight).  CombinedXYPlotDemo4 shows the result.

Price history for binary and multi-claims with Book, AMM, and both.
       [See ChartingPlans.txt]

make the value of a basket be adjustable.  Choose a consistent way to display it.

Time zones (on Transaction History page) should be configurable by the user

Track account values
  enable control of account balance on creation
  enable admin modifications to account balances
  ensure all changes to account balance are logged
    creation
    closing markets
    deposits & withdrawals

judge's estimate not proofed.   (No current ability to print errors.)

Rewrite ClaimPurchase:historyChartNameForJsp() to use the mechanism
in ChartTest:testDrawChartFromDB() to retrieve data.   (PERFORMANCE)

Withdraw bids when users exceed their budget.

Why do smaller quantities in multi-markets seem to move prices
comparably to binary markets?

claimPurchase() tries to work even if there aren't cookies.  Should
this pattern be removed or copied to other pages?  see useCookie and
setUserFromCookie().
