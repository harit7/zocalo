  Separate: show price frontiers using XYStepAreaRenderer.  Show transactions (w/color for
        buy/sell) and volumes. 
     Interim: Show price range on trades.  (Not necessary to show price frontier.)  So OHLC with
  		moving average should be fine.  (HighLowChartDemo2) + volume

Should marketMaker history show quantities?  (YES)

To graph a book-only binary market, show best offer frontiers, transactions and volume.
   Show buys in green and sells in red?

x A slow maker-driven market should show open close using XYStepRenderer from an XYDataset.
A busier maker would aggregate by days/weeks/etc. using OHLC.
