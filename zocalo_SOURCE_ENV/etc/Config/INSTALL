                INSTALLATION STEPS

  * Configure the Zocalo server
  * Start the database server
  * Start the Zocalo server
  * How to Configure and Run Markets
  * How to Create New Accounts
  * Navigation

**************************************************

* Configure the Zocalo server

	 * SET THE ADMIN PASSWORD
	 * SET THE USERS' CURRENCY ALLOCATION
	 * SPECIFY THE PORT
	 * CONFIGURE THE LOCATION OF THE DATABASE.
	 * CONFIGURE THE MAIL SYSTEM
	 * SET FLAG FOR COST LIMITS IF DESIRED

The following parameters can be modified by editing the file
etc/zocalo.conf.

* SET THE ADMIN PASSWORD

The admin password controls claim creation.  It is defined in the
configuration file.  The default value (the word "unsafe") is published on
sourceforge!  YOU MUST CHANGE IT TO HAVE ANY SECURITY!  Pick something
people won't guess.  You can remind yourself of what it is whenever you
need to by looking in the config file (etc/zocalo.conf).

  admin.password: unsafe

You authenticate as admin by logging in with any name (whether known to the
system or not) and the password from the config file.  After you have
authenticated as admin, you will be able to create new markets.  You drop
admin authentication by logging in without a password.


* SET THE USERS' CURRENCY ALLOCATION

You can modify the initial amount of currency that users get in their
accounts by changing initial.user.funds.  It's $1000 to start with.

  initial.user.funds: 1000


* SPECIFY THE PORT

The Zocalo Server needs to know what port to use.  80 is the standard
port number for web pages, so the web addresses are much simpler if
that port is available on the machine that runs Zocalo.  Many
Operating Systems are configured to ensure that user processes don't
run on low-numbered ports, so we have a default of 30000.  If you want
to use another port in order to get past a firewall or because port 80 is
available, you can change this parameter.

  server.port: 30000


* CONFIGURE THE LOCATION OF THE DATABASE.

If you intend to run a server long term, you should expect to upgrade
the software, which means you need to save the database.  The database
location is controlled by the parameters database.url.file,
database.url.base, and database.file.base.  You shouldn't need to
change url.base unless you want to use a different database than hsql,
which is currently shipped and configured with Zocalo.  file.base
controls where the database stores its files.  If you are changing it,
it would be best to make it an absolute path.  url.file is ensures
coordination between the hsql server we start and Zocalo's server.

* CONFIGURE THE MAIL SYSTEM

When new users register, Zocalo will send them a message asking them
to confirm their email address.  In order to deliver the message,
Zocalo needs to be able to login to a mail server.  Use these parameters to
configure a mail server and account that will allow sending outgoing
messages.

mail.host: mail.example.com
mail.user: emailaccount
mail.password: emailPassword
mail.secure: false
mail.auth: true

If you use a mail server (like gmail) that supports TLS for security,
you should change mail.secure: to true, and add  "mail.port: 465".

When new users register with the server, it autmatically sends them
email with a secret url for them to visit to confirm their
registration.  You can change the text and format of the message by
editing the files in the templates directory.  In particular,
templates/siteConstants.st includes the return address that will be
provided on these outgoing messages.

* SET FLAG FOR COST LIMITS IF DESIRED

A new feature allows user's screens to accept input in terms of a cost
limit rather than a quantity limit.  (Users specify a maximum cost of
an order rather than a maximum quantity.)  This is currently
configurable at install time, and aplies to all multi-market
purchasing.  If you want this functionality, specify 

useCostLimit: true

in the configuration file.

**************************************************

* Start the Database server

Run the script bin/startDB.  This will start the database server in the
background.  If the database doesn't exist, it will be initialized.

**************************************************

* Start the Zocalo server

Run the script bin/zocalo.csh, which will invoke Java to run the
server.  This will print a running log of the server's actions on a
fresh console.  A copy will also be written to
logs/ZocaloServer***.log.  ('***' will be replaced by a sequence
number.)  You can change the logfile name in zocalo.conf.

**************************************************

* How to Configure and Run Markets

The login page for the Zocalo markets is Welcome.jsp.  There are no
accounts or markets configured when the system is first installed.  Users
who have authenticated with the admin password can create new markets.
So you first want to create an account (and confirm it) and then
authenticate as admin and login in order to create accounts.

* How to Create New Accounts

You can create a new account by visiting the Account Creation page
from the login page.  Don't lose the password; there's currently no
way to recover or change it.  New accounts start out with the funding
that was configured when Zocalo was installed.  (This parameter can
also be changed or viewed by opening etc/zocalo.conf.)

In order to authenticate as admin, login with any user name and the
admin password.  You can drop the admin authority by logging in with
any account name and a blank password.  Admin is not a separate
account; instead it's a role that you can have while logged in that
allows you to create new markets.  Once you see the message "Added
Admin credentials. .... ", you login again with an account that you
have confirmed.

While you have admin authority, an extra button ("Create Markets") will be
added to the row of navigation buttons at the top of each page.  Visiting
that page allows you to create new markets.  Binary Markets (2 outcomes
labelled "yes" and "no") and multi-outcome markets (enter a set of labels
separated by commas) can be created.  Binary markets can be created with or
without a market maker.  When you include a market maker, users will be
able to trade directly with the market maker in addition to adding or
accepting book orders.  When there's no market maker, the market is a
simple double auction: people can post offers to buy or sell and can accept
existing offers.  Multi-outcome markets currently operate only with the
market maker.  Integrating book orders is a future project.


* Navigation

The server offers non-admin users a choice of 4 pages:

* The Markets page ("all markets") lists all the open markets and their
   price levels and lets you go to the trading pages for each market.

* The Trading page shows a price history, the best bids and asks, your
   holdings and orders, and lets you enter new orders.  

* The Account page shows outstanding orders and holdings in all
   markets as well as current cash.  

* The History page shows all the trades you've made.
