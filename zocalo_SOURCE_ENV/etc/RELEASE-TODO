This release of Zocalo contains the prediction market engine.  The
engine currently supports economics experiments designed by
researchers at George Mason University and Chapman University, others
in use at MIT's Center for Collective Intelligence, and general
persistent prediction markets.  Here's a short list of incomplete
functionality:

* Conditional claims.

* Email notification to traders when book orders are accepted.

* Configure chart sizes.

* Time limits on orders
