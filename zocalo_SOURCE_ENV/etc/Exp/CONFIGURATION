          CONFIGURING AN EXPERIMENT USING ZOCALO

Zocalo supports laboratory market experiments with a continuous double
auction.  Traders can be given clues as to the underlying value of the
asset being traded as the session proceeds.  Each trader sees a price
history graph, as well as information about the existing bids and
asks, and has the ability to enter new orders or accept existing orders.
Traders can be given varying incentives to manipulate the market
price.   "Forecasters" can view the price history, and try to
determine the value based on the pattern of trading behavior.
Communication between traders can be simulated by displaying a
message as the result of voting between rounds.

There are a few high-level configuration choices to make in planning
an experiment using Zocalo, and several details that must be specified
in every case.  Whatever configuration you choose, you will have to
specify how many rounds the experiment will last and the values the
asset will take on, list the names and roles of the participants,
describe their initial assets and the hints they will receive through
the rounds, and a few other details.  The normal configuration has
prices that range from 0 to 100, though the top end of that range is
configurable using the maxPrice parameter.

There are four main configuration choices that determine the flavor of
the market.  They control whether the traders retain their existing
holdings through a series of sessions or start over with new assets
each round, whether new bids must be at better prices than existing
bids, what kinds of participants the experiment requires and whether
the asset is a unary asset or binary coupon.  You can also run
experiments in which some traders receive a private dividend for each
asset they hold.  This can be instead of or in addition to the common
value of the asset.

Three variations (communication, manipulation, and loans) on the basic
experiment are available; at most one of them can be active for any
experiment.  In the communication treatment, traders can cast a vote
following some trading rounds which will determine which message is
shown to all traders the following round.  In the manipulation
treatment, some participants have an incentive to manipulate the
price, and judges don't trade, but try to determine the underlying
value of the asset.  In lending markets, traders get loans based on
their assets, which are priced according to a configurable parameter.

The current interface only supports experiments in which all bids and
asks are for a single unit.  The trader specifies only the price.  (This is
not required by the underlying market implementation, and in fact,
the prediction market interface allows traders to specify both price
and quantity.  If traders should be allowed to specify quantity, this
would be straightforward to change in the software.  Feel free to make
changes yourself, or contact me for advice.)

The parameters that control the high-level configuration are

carryForward: true
 This parameter determines whether assets are reset
 each round.  If set to true, then trading results are retained each
 round, and new hints provide additional information about the same
 good.  Rewards are added to cash as dividends.

 If CarryForward is set to false, traders' cash and asset values are
 added to their score (separate from holdings) at the end of each
 round, and they start each round with the same initial endowment of
 cash and coupons.

displayCarryForwardScores: true
  This parameter defaults to true.  If set to false, the display of
  carryForward scores is suppressed.

actualValue:          0,          100,         40
dividendValue:        0,          100,         40
 The use of the dividendValue parameter (actualValue is an alternate
 name for the same value and continues to be supported) is affected by
 the setting of the carryForward parameter.  The parameter controls
 the value of the asset used as the value of tickets held at the end
 of each round or as the dividend paid out on coupons held.  If both
 dividendValue and actualValue are present, dividendValue is used.
 Private dividends are configured using individual payCommonDividend
 and privateDividends fields.  (See below for details.)

 Usually, the same underlying asset value will be used as the standard
 of comparison for the forecasters as for rewarding the traders.  When
 this isn't the case (for example, judges are asked to estimate
 per-round values while trading is on long-term value), judge.target
 can be specified.
judge.target: 40,          50,    60

betterPriceRequired: true
 If this is set to "True", then traders can only
 enter new orders that improve on the prices already displayed in the
 book.  If they try to enter a price that is the same as the best
 existing bid or ask, they will see an error message, and can try
 again.  If the value is set to "false", they can enter new prices at
 any level.  The default is "True".

useUnaryAssets: true
 This parameter controls which style of assets is
 offered.  "true" says that all ticket holdings will be positive, and
 that participants can only sell assets if they have some on hand.  

 If the parameter is set to "false", holdings can be positive or
 negative.  The model is that there are two complementary assets,
 which represent true and false outcomes.  One of the two will pay off
 $1 and the other will be worthless.  Prices are displayed in terms of
 the true outcome.  Since the outcomes and the coupons are
 complementary, buying true is equivalent to selling false, and you
 buy false by entering orders to sell true coupons.  Whenever the
 prices in the double auction coincide, a trade takes place.  When
 dividends are combined with binary assets, traders who have negative
 holdings will be required to pay the dividends.  Another parameter,
 requireReserves, controls whether they are required to set aside
 reserves to cover the cost as a condition of the purchase.
 maxDividend indicates how much reserves are required per round.  If
 not set, the maximum actualValue/dividendValue will be used.

maxDividend: 70

 The parameters described above control the general format of the
 market.  Each experiment must additionally configure the number of
 users, their roles, what assets they will have and trade, and what
 information they will receive over the course of the experiment.  

Traders with different starting assets can be configured, and
experiments can include manipulators (who have an incentive to
influence the price) and judges (who monitor market transactions and
attempt to predict the actual prices).  If any manipulators are
present, there must also be at least one judge, since manipulators'
scores depend on the judge's predictions.  

When Loans are allowed, each trader will be offered a loan up to
markToMarket.loan.ratio multiplied by the value of their assets
(valued according to the capitalGains parameter, which can be one of
historicCost, fundamentalValue, or the default markToMarket).
HistoricCost says that the assets are valued according to their
purchase price, MarkToMarket says use the last trading value in the
market, and FundamentalValue requires that a value be specified for
each round (e.g. FundamentalValue: 240, 200, 130, 60).  The value of
the initial holdings in the historicCost case are determined by the
coupon.basis setting.  You can ensure that players have to settle
their loans before the experiment is over by specifying a value for
loansDueInRound.

------------------------------

sessionTitle: CarryForward-10.11
 This parameter will be used for the file name in which experiment
 results are logged and reported by the summarizing scripts.

rounds: 3
 The number of rounds in the experiment.  Various fields below specify
 values for each round.  They must have this many values separated by
 commas or tabs. 

roles: judge, manipulator, blueTrader, redTrader
 The list of roles that participants may take on.  JUDGE and
 MANIPULATOR are special (their names cannot be changed).  All other
 roles are different varieties of trader.  If there are any
 manipulators present, you must have at least one forecaster, as the
 scoring rule for manipulators relies on the average of the
 forecasters' scores.

 Endowment and tickets must be specified for each trader role and for
 the manipulator role when they will be used.  

players: traderA1, traderB, traderA2, Forecaster1
 The list of players participating.  This is what determines how many
 accounts there will be.  Each player's role must be specified, and
 other values are required depending on what the role is.  It is not
 necessary that all accounts be used in every session, so you can
 define extra players that are only used in some cases.  (For example,
 if you can't predict exactly how many subjects will be available at
 any session.)

timeLimit: 2
 The number of minutes each round should last.  The time remaining is
 displayed to all participants, and the market is disabled when time
 is up.  The experimenter starts the round, and can end it early if
 the market seems to have settled down.  The experimenter determines
 how long to wait for forecasters to enter their predictions, and when
 to start the next round.

maxPrice: 100
 The default price range for experiments is from 0 to 100.  The
 maximum price can be changed by setting the maxPrice parameter.  

traderA1.role: blueTrader
traderA2.role: redTrader
traderB.role: manipulator
Forecaster1.role: judge

 The three roles supported are trader, judge, and manipulator.
 forecasters (judge) don't trade; their role is to watch the trading
 and guess the underlying value of the tickets.  Multiple Trader roles
 can be configured.  The role listed for each participant must match
 one of the names give on the "roles:" line.  

 Traders can be given a hint each round about the underlying value of
 the asset.  They are rewarded for the value of their cash and assets.

 Manipulators trade and are rewarded for their holdings, plus a bonus
 that increases as the judges' prediction gets closer to the
 manipulator's target.  They can be given hints about the underlying
 value, in addition to any information they receive about how their
 bonus is determined.  The formulas for rewarding judges and
 manipulators can each be determined in two ways

 Traders and Manipulators begin the session (in the carryforward case)
 or each round (when carryforward is false) with cash and tickets as
 specified using endowment.<role> or tickets<role>
endowment.blueTrader: 200
endowment.redTrader: 300
endowment.manipulator: 150
tickets.blueTrader: 2
tickets.redTrader: 5
tickets.manipulator: 3

The bonus for judges and manipulators can be specified by providing
parameters that will be substituted into a formula.  There is an
alternative for each of the formulas.  Both formulas depend on a
factor and a constant.  The judge's formula is based on the square of
the difference between the individual judge's estimate and the actual
value.  The manipulator's formula is based on the difference between
an individual target and the average of the judges' estimates.  Each
expression is then multiplied by the factor and incremented by the
constant.  The alternative for the manipulator's bonus is just the
difference between their target and the average of the judges'
guesses.  The alternative formula is specified by assigning the
parameter manipulatorRewards the token "difference".

#manipulatorRewards:  difference
scoringFactor.manipulator: 2
scoringConstant.Manipulator: 200
 Traders are rewarded for the value of their assets at the end of each
 round.  Manipulators are rewarded for their assets plus a bonus based
 on the difference between their target and the average of the judges'
 guesses.  The formula for the manipulator bonus is
     constant - (difference * factor)

scoringFactor.judge: .022
scoringConstant.judge: 250
 Judges are rewarded with a bonus based on the square of the
 difference between their guess and the actual value of the tickets.
 The Judge's bonus is
     constant - (difference * difference * factor)


  The Judges' bonus
can be specified by providing a table of values corresponding to
particular input choices.  There are two ways to restrict the judges
input choices to particular values, either a pull-down menu or a
slider.  With the menu, you provide an explicit list of input values,
while with the slider only regularly spaced values are available and
you specify the step size and the numeric labels to display.  The
value of judgeInputChoices can either be the word "slider" or the
numeric values to be displayed in the menu.  If "slider" is specified,
judgeSliderStepsize and judgeSliderLabelStepsize can also be specified.
(If not provided, they will default to 5 and 20 respectively.)  

judgeInputChoices: 0, 5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85,90,95,100
judgeInputChoices: slider
judgeSliderLabelStepsize: 5
judgeSliderStepsize: 20

When input choices have been specified, judges' rewards can be given
by an explicit list of values corresponding to each possible input
choice.  Rewards are assigned based on the difference between each
judge's estimate and the actualValue for the round.

judgingRewards:     0,5,10,15,20,25,30,35,40,45,50,54.5,58.5,62,65,67.5,69.5,71,72,72.5,72.7

initialHint: Trading has not started yet.
 Participants see this message when they login if the session hasn't
 started yet.  You can change the message to provide whatever
 information is relevant.
 
Private Dividends

 You can assign private valuations to individual traders by specifying
 payCommonDividend and  privateDividends by trader name.  Traders who
 always or never get the common dividend can have it specified only
 once like traderB below.  Traders who would ever get a private
 dividend must have values specified for every round.

traderA.payCommonDividend: yes, no, no
traderB.payCommonDividend: yes
traderA.privateDividends: 30, 60, 40
traderB.privateDividends: 40, 80, 20

------------------------------

 The next set of the parameters concerning messages for the traders to
 see require values to be specified for each round.

not100: The ticket value is not 100.
not40: The ticket value is not 40.
notZero: The ticket value is not 0.
raisePrice: Some players are trying to raise the apparent price
changePrice: Some players are trying to change the apparent price
noMessage:
worth40: Your score will improve if the judge thinks the tickets are worth 40
worth100: Your score will improve if the judge thinks the ticket are worth 100
 Parameters that take string values can either be specified
 explicitly in line, or can use tags.  Tags are defined by putting
 the name at the beginning of a line followed by a colon.  The rest of
 the line determines the value.  This makes it easy to reuse messages
 several times and ensure they are the same.  None of the tags are
 built in.    These are examples that have been used before.

commonMessage:        raisePrice, changePrice, noMessage
 The common message is shown to all participants, and remains on their
 screen during the round.  

The common message can be replaced by a message telling participants
whether the average trading price in the previous round was higher
or lower than the dividend value.  dividendValue or actualValue
along with both "above" and "below" messages must be defined for
this setting to take effect.  The message can be defined to include
the percentage difference, the absolute difference, or can omit
those data-dependent values.  In order to include the difference as
a percentage (in which case the dividend shouldn't be zero), insert
the word "percent" between a pair of dollar signs in the text.  To
print the value as the absolute difference, insert "difference".
The dollar signs will not appear in the displayed text. To insert a
literal dollar sign, precede it with two backslashes.  ("\\$")

aboveThresholdMessage: The price is %$percent$ too high
belowThresholdMessage: The price is $difference$ cents too low

There's also a parameter to specify what value the threshold should
take.  There are three choices currently.  "thresholdValue: dividend"
means that the threshold each period is that period's dividend value.
"thresholdValue: remainingDividend" means that the threshold each
period is the total of all the dividend values over the remaining
periods.  The third choice is to give a list of explicit values for
the threshold for each period.

thresholdValue: 200, 190, 180, 170, 160, 150, 140
thresholdValue: remainingDividend
thresholdValue: dividend

traderA.hint:         not100,     not40,       not100
traderB.hint:         not40,      notZero,     notZero
manipulatorC.hint:    not100,     notZero,     notZero
 Traders and manipulators can be given a hint each round.  If
 carryForward is true, the hint should be additional information about
 the assets that continue to be traded.  If carryForward is false, the
 hint gives the trader's or manipulator's clue for the round.

 The names before the period (".") should be the actual names entered
 in the "players" parameter above.  The experiment won't work if you
 specify player names and don't set up their hints, of if you give
 hints for names that are omitted from the players list.

manipulatorC.earningsHint: worth40, worth40,   worth100
manipulatorC.target:  40,         40,          100
 Manipulators have a target price that they are trying to convince the
 forecasters is the actual value of the underlying asset.  The target
 value is used in calculating their bonus.  The earnings hint gives
 you the opportunity to provide an appropriate incentive.  It doesn't
 have to be consistent with the value used in the score.  If you want
 it to be consistent, compare the two lines carefully.

------------------------------

The Voting configuration provides a kind of communication between
traders.  This condition can be enabled by specifying the following
parameters.  You specify the messages from which the traders select
using voteText.N, after you have indicated how many such messages
there will be.  The most popular message will be displayed during the
rounds indicated as "voteBeforeRounds".  votePrompt lets you specify
the text that appears above the message.

voteAlternatives: 3
voteText.1: The price is too high
voteText.2: The price is too low
voteText.3: The price is correct
voteBeforeRounds: 2, 4
votePrompt: Please vote for a message to be displayed:<br>

------------------------------

Finally, there are some parameters that allow you to change the
appearance of the screens:

This parameter provides a string to override the default "Your clue",
which describes a message given to a particular trader in an
experiment.  If no value or an illegal value is provided the default
will be used.

messageLabel: Your clue


This parameter provides a string to override the default "Shared
Message", which describes a message given to all traders in an
experiment.  If no value or an illegal value is provided the default
will be used.

commonMessageLabel: Shared Message


The word "round" is used to describe one timed segment of an experiment session.  It is probably worth replacing it with something very visible (like "roundLabel: <font size='+2'><b>period</b></font>") and running through a complete session to see where it appears.

roundLabel
   "round"


You can suppress the Earnings display after each round by setting
showEarnings to false.  It defaults to true if unspecified.

showEarnings: false


Setting this parameter causes the server to list the average trade
price over each round when it displays the scores to the subjects.

displayAverages: true


The following labels are used in displaying scores depending on configuration of the experiment.  Rather than describe each separately, the default value is shown.

actualValueLabel
   "Actual Ticket Value"
assetsPlusBonusLabel
   "Total<br><font size='-2'>(assets + bonus)</font>"
averagePriceLabel
  "Average Price"
dividendsAddedToCashLabel
   "Total Dividend added to Cash"
dividendsPlusBonusLabel
   "Total (Added to Cash)<br><font size='-2'>(dividends + bonus)</font>" 
dividendsubtractedFromReservesLabel
   "Total Dividend subtracted from Reserves"
dividendValueLabel
   "Dividend Value"
publicValueLabel
   "Common Dividend Value"
privateValueLabel
   "Private Dividend Value"
totalAssetsLabel
   "Total Asset Value<br><font size='-2'>(cash +tickets)</font>"
totalDividendLabel
   "Total Dividend" 	  


An extra table can be displayed while scores are displayed giving an extra level of description of the outcome and scoring.  To turn it on, define an outcome for each period using eventOutcome.  The labels in the table can be defined as well.  Traders, Manipulators, and Judges have different colums.  The default values for the labels are shown.

eventOutcome: Red, Green, Red, Red, Green

judgeEarningsLabel: Earnings
judgeInvestmentLabel: Investment in Black
manipulatorEarningsLabel: Earnings<br><small>(Multiplier x Average Investment)</small>
manipulatorInvestmentLabel: Average Investment

traderEarningsLabel: Earnings<br><small>(Cash + Reserves + Shares x Value)</small>
traderInvestmentLabel: Value

---------------------------

During experiments, the software displays the Zocalo logo unless the logoPath parameter is defined.  It can be blank, or contain a filename or a URL.   If you put a web-compatible file in the directory webpages/images, you can refer to it with a local reference.  The zocalo image is images/logo.zocalo.jpg
