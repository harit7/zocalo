# The common message can be replaced by a message telling

# round was higher or lower than some value.  The value may be
# specified with the "thresholdValue" parameter, which can take the
# values "dividend", "remainingDividend", or an explicit list giving
# the threshold for each round.  All three of "thresholdValue",
# "aboveThresholdMessage" and "belowThresholdMessage" must be
# defined for this setting to take effect.  The message can be
# defined to include the percentage difference, the absolute
# difference, or can omit any data-dependent values.  In order to
# include the difference as a percentage (in which case the dividend
# shouldn't be zero), insert the word "percent" between a pair of
# dollar signs in the text.  To print the value as the absolute
# difference, insert "difference".  The dollar signs will not appear
# in the displayed text. To insert a literal dollar sign, precede it
# with two backslashes.  ("\\$")
