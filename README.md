Zocalo is a toolkit for building prediction markets, markets in securities that pay out depending on outcomes of future events. They provide estimates of the likelihood of specific outcomes that are more reliable than other sources of predictions.
This project is based on http://zocalo.sourceforge.net/
Here we are maintaining the changes we have made to zocalo.
